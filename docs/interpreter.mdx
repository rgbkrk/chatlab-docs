# Code Interpreter

There is a builtin code interpreter that lets the assistant run code. It's not enabled by default.

```python cell count=1
from chatlab import Conversation
from chatlab.builtins import run_cell

conversation = Conversation()
conversation.register(run_cell)
conversation.submit("Please calculate sin(793.1)")
```

<OutputBlock count={1}>
  <ChatFunctionCall
    open
    name="run_cell"
    input={'{\n  "code": "import math\\nmath.sin(793.1)"\n}'}
    output="0.9884482539459452"
  />

The value of sin(793.1) is approximately 0.9884482539459452.

## Data Personas

You can let ChatGPT take on a data persona with a `system` message and then have it work with `DataFrame`s you have in memory.

```python
from chatlab import Conversation, system
from chatlab.builtins import run_cell
import pandas as pd

# The Chicago Public Library location dataset
df = pd.read_json("https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/x8fc-8rcq.json")

conversation = Conversation(
    system(
        "You are a data scientist running inside a Jupyter Notebook, "
        "collaborating with a data engineer."
    ),
)
conversation.register(run_cell)
conversation.submit("Please tell me about what's in `df`")
```

## The hidden `python` hallucination

Sometimes GPT models will hallucinate a `python` tool that accepts a single string rather than the proper JSON object that `run_cell` requests. You can include it in your `Conversation` to handle these cases.

```python cell count=1
from chatlab import Conversation
from chatlab.builtins import run_cell

conversation = Conversation(
    allow_hallucinated_python=True
)
conversation.register(run_cell)
conversation.submit("Please calculate sin(793.1)")
```

<OutputBlock count={3}>
  <ChatFunctionCall
    open
    name="python"
    input={"import math\nmath.sin(793.1)"}
    output="0.9884482539459452"
  />
</OutputBlock>
